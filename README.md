# nasa api key stuff


This program uses the Nasa NEOWSS api to check all near earth objects that have passed by today. It then counts how many were potentially hazardous and adds them to a file. You are able to check the total count of hazardous objects too, like the past 3 days or 2 weeks, all up to your choice.
